---------- PATCH 1.2 - TOTAL HEALER AND PVP SPECIALIZATION REWORK ----------

This patch introduced significant changes to many classes and builds. I was sick and tired of telling people that some builds sadly did not work well in a solo setting, either because they were critically underpowered or were a boring 
slog to play. Healing and absorb effects were also an overpowered element that had to be adressed due to the nature of the Autobalance and Beastmaster / Pet Tank modules. I am happy to say that these issues have been resolved. You are 
now free to play whichever class and build sounds cool and not be penalized for it.

GENERAL CHANGES
Greatly reduced the power of most healing spells and effects in the game, down to 10% on average
Greatly increased the mana cost of most healing spells, healers should expect to cast on average 5-6 big heals before running out of mana
Greatly increased the damage-dealing capabilities of "healing" builds

PRIEST CHANGES
The Priest class was hit the hardest by these changes. All builds play as mages and hybrid builds have been made a more appealing choice. Via some talent and spell rework, Power Word: Shield has been made more or less ineffective for 
anyone but Discipline Priests and likewise Devouring Plague for Shadow Priests.
Holy:
Searing Light (talent) - now increase Smite, Holy Fire and Holy Nova damage by 20/40% (up from 5/10%)
Spirit of Redemption - on-death effect removed, now increases spirit by 10% (up from 5%)
Surge of Light (talent) - proc chance for an instant Smite or Flash Heal increased to 50/100% (up from 25/50%)
Discipline:
Inner Focus (talent/spell) cooldown reduced to 30 seconds (down from 3 minutes)
Soul Warding (talent) now reduces the mana cost of Power Word: Shield by 80% (up from 15%)
Reflective Shield (talent) Power Word: Shield now reflects 50/100% of the damage it absorbs to the attacker (up from 22/44%)
Penance (talent/spell) healing component removed, cooldown reduced to 6 seconds (down from 12 seconds)
Shadow:
Devouring Plague (spell) 60 second cooldown added and damage greatly reduced
Improved Devouring Plague (talent) now increases periodic damage of Devouring Plague by 100/200/300% (up from 5/10/15%)
Silence (talent/spell) cooldown reduced to 20 seconds (down from 45 seconds)
Vampiric Embrace (talent/spell) healing granted reduced to 3% self and 0.1% party (down from 15% self and 3% party)
Improved Vampiric Embrace (talent) increases healing granted by Vampiric Embrace by 50/100% (up from 33/66%)
Psychic Horror (spell/talent) disarm component removed, cooldown reduced to 30 seconds (down from 3 minutes)

PALADIN CHANGES
Holy Paladins are now effectively exorcist-mages and some love has been shown to Protection Paladins, who suffered due to their mana-regain mechanic being tied to other people and Vanilla's poorly thought out itemization. Retribution 
Paladins were in an extremely powerful position before, so they received no buffs to counter the healing / absorb rebalance.
Holy:
Sacred Shield (spell) - 6 second cooldown added
Divine Favor (talent/spell) - cooldown reduced to 20 seconds (down from 2 minutes)
Purifying Power (talent) - mana cost reduction of Cleanse, Purify and Consecration increased to 50/100% (up from 5/10%)
Holy Shock (talent/spell) - healing component removed, damage increased, cooldown reduced to 5 seconds (down from 6 seconds)
Infusion of Light (talent) - reworked, Holy Shock critical hits now has a 50/100% chance of making your next Holy Shock also a critical hit (cannot proc off itself)
Divine Beacon (talent/spell) redesigned into Divine Bolt (talent/spell), a Holy damage long range spell
Protection:
Spiritual Attunement (talent) redesigned, now offers a 25/50% mana cost reduction on all instant cast spells

SHAMAN CHANGES
Restoration Shamans are now effectively water mages and some love has been shown to the other trees to counter the healing / absorb rebalance.
Restoration:
Tidal Force (talent/spell) replaced, now teaches the Shaman a fast-casting, low mana cost Frost damage long ranged spell
Nature's Swiftness (talent/spell) replaced with Sphere of Water (talent/spell), a Frost damage over time spell on an 8 second cooldown
Riptide (talent/spell) has been redesigned, it is now a Frost damage over time spell on a 6 second cooldown
Elemental:
Elemental Mastery (talent/spell) cooldown reduced to 1 minute 45 seconds (down from 3 minutes)
Enhancement:
Improved Stormstrike (talent) base mana regained from Stormstrike increased to 50% (up from 20%)

DRUID CHANGES
Due to Tree of Life's nature it was nearly impossible to use the build in a fun way in a solo setting, so Restoration Druids have been completely redesigned and now fill the role of close-range AoE magic damage dealers.
Restoration:
Omen of Clarity (talent) replaced with Wind's Blessing (talent), which gives your spells and attacks a good chance to give you a 15% movement speed boost for 2 seconds
Nature's Swiftness (talent/spell) replaced with Dream Strike, a melee attack that deals Nature damage and benefits greatly from bonus spell power
Swiftmend (talent/spell) replaced with Burst of Pollen (talent/spell), a damage over time area effect on a 6 second cooldown
Tree of Life (talent/spell) armor bonus removed, does not prevent the player from using new Restoration damage spells
Improved Tree of Life (talent) armor bonus reduced to 33/66/100% (down from 67/133/200%)
Revitalize (talent) proc chance increased to 33/66/100% (up from 5/10/15%)
Wild Growth (talent/spell) replaced with Petrified Root (talent/spell), a medium range splash damage spell
Balance:
Force of Nature (talent/spell) redesigned into Omen of Clarity (talent) from the Restoration tree

ROGUE CHANGES
Rogues were in a very bad place from a solo perspective, they were by far the weakest option when picking a damage-dealing class and had only one truly effective dungeon build (Combat Daggers). Some talents and abilities were improved 
to make them a more appealing option and broaden the player's choices when deciding on an effective build.
Assassination:
Master Poisoner (talent) now increases critical strike chance by 5/10/15% (up from 1/2/3%)
Hunger for Blood (talent/spell) now increases damage by 15% (up from 5%)      
Combat:
Savage Might (talent) now increases attack power and damage by 5/10% (up from 2/4%)
Killing Spree (talent/spell) cooldown reduced to 1 minute (down from 2 minutes)
Subtlety:
Slaughter from the Shadows (talent) now reduces the cost of Backstab and Ambush by 15/20/25/30/35 energy (up from 4/8/12/16/20)

WARLOCK CHANGES
Warlocks are uneffected by the healing rebalance brought by this patch, as their extreme mana-inefficiency is countered by sacrificing their own health for mana via Life Tap, which in turn needs to be countered by self-healing effects. 
A single talent was changed to improve Destruction due to the fact that Destruction Warlocks rely on the Imp pet, which is not a viable option for solo dungeon play.
Destruction:
Backdraft (talent) now has no effect on global cooldown, but reduces the casting time of the next three Destruction spells by 33/66/100% (up from 10/20/30%)

MAGE CHANGES
Frost Mages received a capstone improvement to make deep Frost specialization a more viable and appealing option.
Frost:
Deep Freeze (talent/spell) cooldown reduced to 10 seconds (down from 30 seconds)

WARRIOR CHANGES
Arms Warriors received some talent improvements to make deep Arms specialization a more viable and appealing option.
Arms:
Sword Specialization (talent) proc chance increased to 20/40/60/80/100% (up from 2/4/6/8/10%)
Wrecking Crew (talent) now also triggers Second Wind rank 1/2


---------- 1.2.1 - Celebratory Day 1 Patch ----------

Fixed a naming oversight in the Improved Healing (Holy Priest) talent


---------- 1.2.2 ----------

Fixed talent clarification to better reflect Vanilla+ nature and the 1.2.0 rework

PET CHANGES
Pets had similar problems as some specializations used to - some were simply not viable picks for solo dungeon runs (namely, any pet not in the Tenacity family). This was unacceptable, as pets are now main tanks for the player, so the
"tank value" of Cunning and Ferocity pets was increased significantly. Tenacity pets are still the best at a tanking role, but Cunning is now a close second, and Ferocity a close third.

Dash / Dive (talen/spell) from the Cunning and Ferocity pet trees were redesigned into Attack Anticipation (talent/spell)
Attack Anticipation (talent/spell) grants the pet a 10% dodge boost for 4 seconds, 16 second cooldown
Mobility (talent) from the Cunning tree redesigned into Foresight (talent), which reduces the cooldown of Attack anticipation by 4/8 seconds
Heart of the Phoenix (talent) from Ferocity clarified, before it mislead the player into thinking it would trigger on its own upon pet death

ROGUE CHANGES
Full Subtlety Rogues still suffered from a lack of sustained damage dealing potential due to their lack of an energy-regenerating talent, mainly focusing on bursts, so their talents were changed in an effort to make them much harder to 
kill and make them that much more distinct from other builds. Going for yet another energy management talent seemed like a very boring option, this will give Rogue players a little more variety.
Subtlety:
Sleight of Hand (talent) crit chance reduction increased to 3/6% (up from 1/2%)
Setup (talent) no longer adds a combo point, now heals the Rogue for 100 points
Heightened Sense (talent) hit chance reduction increased to 5/10% (up from 2/4%)
Preparation (talent/spell) cooldown reduced to 3 minutes
Enveloping Shadows (talent) area damage reduction increased to 20/40/60% (up from 10/20/30%)
Honor Among Thieves (talent) no longer adds a combo point, now heals the rogue for 100 points
Filthy Tricks (talent) cooldown reduction changed to 30/60 seconds (down from 90/180 seconds)

PRIEST CHANGES
Holy:
Circle of Healing (talent/spell) redesigned into Beam of Light (spell/talent)
Beam of Light (talent/spell) has a 15 second cooldown and fires at an area, dealing instant Holy Damage to all targets withing 15 yards of the strike
Discipline:
Power Infusion (talent/spell) cooldown reduced to 30 seconds (down from 3 minutes)
Pain Suppression (talent/spell) cooldown reduced to 30 seconds (down from 3 minutes)
Penance (talent/spell) damage greatly increased and cooldown reduced to 6 seconds
Shadow:
Pain and Suffering (talent) self-inflicted Shadow Word: Death damage reduction increased to 33/66/100% (up from 10/20/30%)

PALADIN CHANGES
Retribution:
Judgements of the Wise (talent) mana regained increased to 50% (up from 20%)

Mana Tide Totem (talent/spell) cooldown reduced to 3 minutes (down from 5 minutes)

---------- 1.2.3 ----------

Mages faced a similar problem as Rogues, they underperformed when taken out of a classic MMO setting and put into solo dungeon runs. This patch addresses this by greatly boosting the Mage's survivability via talent improvement and 
damage somewhat. This should be the last of the class rework patches, small tweaks might follow but nothing major until patch 1.3.

Ice Block (spell) cooldown decreased to 1 minute (down from 5 minutes)
Arcane Blast (spell) cast time reduced to 2 seconds (down from 2.5 seconds)

---------- 1.2.7 ----------

The focus of this patch was making Discipline priests a viable option early game, not just a level 60 one. Crushing Guilt offers enough firepower to rival Shadow and Holy specializations in the early game and scales very well with bonus
spell damage, making it a new part of the level 60 rotation. Synergy was added to early shadow damage boosting talents in the Shadow tree in order to make Discipline/Shadow builds a potential option. In addition, Shadow Word: Pain is
no longer a useful spell for priests without a minor investment in the Shadow tree, in order to compensate for the massive damage increase other builds received.

Inner Focus (talent/spell) redesigned into Crushing Guilt (talent/spell)

DUNGEON CHANGES
Temple of Ahn'Qiraj:
Viscidus encounter completely redesigned and rebalanced
C'thun encounter rebalanced and some abilities altered. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND keeping your pet on passive and at your side during the fight, both as a survival strategy and in order to avoid the eye and body moving about in an
odd manner due to a bug with the pet's attack range when interacting with large NPC models. The fight is completely doable and will not break in any way even if you do not take this advice.

BUGFIXES
Atiesh script fixed

GLYPH CHANGES
I was unable to realize my original idea of what glyphs could be, there were still those shining star glyphs that outpreformed others in a large majority of situations and turned a difficult encounter significantly easier. 
For the sake of balance, most offensive glyphs were overhauled and toned down greatly. There are still those that outperform others depending on the player's gear and spent talents, but the difference is now much less severe. Unless 
stated otherwise in brackets, the old glyph effects have been replaced. Players are now free to pick whatever "feels best" and only nerf themselves the tiniest amount if it isn't the optimal choice.
